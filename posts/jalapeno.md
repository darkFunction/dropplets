My BFL Jalapeno finally arrived.  It's a cute little box but the fan is really whirring away, so I ordered [a replacement](http://www.amazon.co.uk/gp/product/B009LELXQG/ref=oh_details_o00_s00_i00?ie=UTF8&psc=1).  It's sitting in the living room plugged into a Pi which is also acting as a backup file server.  I'm monitoring cgminer on this box through my VPS which has a tmux screen pane devoted to it, so that I can keep an eye on it without having to login all the time.  It's steady around 42Â°C and 5.3Gh/s.
