Just installed Dropplets, love the clean layout and simplicity.  Since the content of the Dropplets site is just a directory with [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/) textfiles, I thought it would be cool to BTSync this folder. Now all I have to do to publish a post is make a new textfile on any machine in the same synced folder, and it will be published as soon as there's an internet connection!
