Just a little status update for the Jalapeno that has been chugging along nicely for just over a month now.  I replaced the obnoxious fan with a quieter one, and about 2 weeks ago I flashed the firmware, putting the speed up to about 7.5GH/s.  This speed increase coincided with the huge difficulty rise earlier in the month, so the graph looks more even than it would if it were still running at stock speed.  Below is my graph from Slush's pool, and a screenshot from CGMiner.  The spike to zero that you can see is me knocking the plug out and not noticing for a day ;)

To date it has paid out 2.50 BTC, which at the current conversion rate is Â£206.05
