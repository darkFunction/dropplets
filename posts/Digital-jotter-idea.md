It would be cool to have some kind of functionality on a blog which allowed you to show all revisions of a post as if it were written down on paper and revised by scribbling out words or paragraphs.  This way you would be able to see all the bad work as well as the good, next to each other in a kind of natural way.  This wouldn't be very suitable for most things, but what I had in mind was language learning.  If I want to keep a blog in French and correct spelling or grammatical mistakes as I learn them, I would want to see some kind of visual history of my errors- it seems more useful than a perfectly presented wall of French text.
