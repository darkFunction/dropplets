I've written a new site in Flask to assist with learning French. The idea is that a new verb is chosen every day, and users are able to see all conjugations as well as search for other verbs. It's been great using Flask- it takes (almost) all of the pain out of web development. Definitely recommend. Visit the site: [Verbe Du Jour](http://www.verbedujour.com)
