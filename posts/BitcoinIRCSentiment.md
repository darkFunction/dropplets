I wrote a Lua bot to sit and monitor the IRC channels listed [here](https://en.bitcoin.it/wiki/IRC_channels) (minus the tickers) for uses of the 'sentiment words' listed [here](https://github.com/goncalopereira/twitter-moods/blob/master/moods). Obviously this has no chance of giving meaningful results but it was a fun project.
